This program it's a Snakes and Ladders game version, you could play with your friends, 
you can play throwing the dice or simulating the game.

This version was created by Alejandro Varela and Juan David Ballesteros. The interesting about 
the work is the application code don't use lists from java lang, util or collections, all lists 
are linked list created by the authors.

## How to play?
Click on Play! then the game will ask you to configure the board and players parameters. 
First settings are about the board size, then you set the quantity of ladders and snakes. 
You continue to set the number of player and the token will be set randomly. 

Then the board will appear and the right side you will see, the player turn to launch the dice. 
Finally you need to click launch an play!

## Rules
Each player will launch the dice one time by round, when a player fall in a Snake head will go 
back to the snake tail cell, the snake id is a letter, the head is always the cell above.

When a player falls in a ladder base, will go up to the top ladder cell, the ladder id is a number 
in the cell right and bottom corner. 

The first player to get in to the last cell will win, and the player with less stapes to win will 
appear in the top scores.
